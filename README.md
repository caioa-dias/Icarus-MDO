# Icarus-MDO

Icarus is a **Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO)** framework developed to support the **conceptual design of low-Reynolds-number aircraft**.  
Over time, different versions of Icarus were developed in both **Python** and **MATLAB**, each associated with specific academic projects, publications, and applications.
